# This script is used as a virtual test setup. By using this script,
# or modifying it as required, developers can quickly build topologies
# and test their changes on their VMs.
# Pre-requisites:
# 1. Checkout the ops-vsi repo.
# 2. Run 'make devenv_ct_init'.
# 3. Export the docker image of the switch from your build directory.

# To run this file, we have to point to the native python inside the sandbox.
# ex: /usr/bin/sudo <SANDBOX>/build/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin/py.test -s example.py
